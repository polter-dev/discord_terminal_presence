# config (package `internal/config`)

**Purpose:** Defines termp's user configuration, defaults, validation, path migration,
serialization, and hot-reload manager.

**Public surface:** `Config` and its nested UI/display/privacy/CTA/tool types are the
runtime schema. `Default`, `DefaultPath`, `Load`, `LoadPath`, and `Save` resolve and
persist it. `AnnotatedSample` and `InitFile(path, force)` support `termp config init`.
`Manager` watches a path and publishes validated changes.

**Key files:** `internal/config/config.go` contains the schema, validation, platform-aware
paths, annotated sample, initialization, load, and atomic save. `internal/config/manager.go`
contains polling-based reload and config-directory setup.

**Invariants / gotchas:** A missing config loads defaults; invalid values return errors
or documented warnings rather than silently changing privacy behavior. Windows migrates
legacy state to the native config directory on a best-effort basis.

Discord-facing config is rejected during load when it cannot produce a valid activity.
Tool and custom-tool buttons allow at most two entries; labels are non-empty and at most
32 characters, and URLs are absolute HTTP(S) URLs. Details/fallback text and custom-tool
identity, display, and resolved image fields are bounded before registry construction.
The feedback target is likewise bounded and restricted to an absolute HTTP(S) URL.
Config reads are capped at 1 MiB before TOML decoding.

`InitFile` uses `Lstat` and refuses symlinks and every other non-regular destination even
with `force`. It writes a temporary file in the destination directory and atomically
renames it. New files are created `0600`; forced replacement of an existing regular file
preserves that file's permission bits. Migration copies also preserve the source mode.
Without `force`, an existing regular file is not replaced.

**Depends on / used by:** Uses BurntSushi TOML and the standard library. The CLI,
detector, presence mapping, TUI, registry construction, and update policy consume it.

**Open questions / TODO:** None currently.
