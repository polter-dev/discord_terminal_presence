# presence (package `internal/presence`)

**Purpose:** Maps detector snapshots into Discord Rich Presence and pushes throttled
updates through one client-owning writer goroutine.

**Public surface:** `Client` abstracts login/activity/logout and `RichClient` implements
validated Discord IPC. `Probe(appID)` performs a login/logout reachability check.
`StatusProbe(ctx, appID)` adds status-specific cancellation and I/O bounds. `Activity`,
`Image`, `Button`, `DisplayOptions`, `ActivityFromDetection`, and `CollectionState` form
the mapping boundary. `Writer` owns reconnect, throttling, coalescing, clear, and replay.

**Key files:** `internal/presence/activity.go` defines payload mapping and privacy-aware
display options. `internal/presence/client.go` owns framing, handshake, deadlines, and
probes. `internal/presence/conn_unix.go` and `conn_windows.go` discover, validate, and
dial IPC endpoints. `internal/presence/writer.go` owns client lifecycle.

**Invariants / gotchas:** Directory display is off by default and callers pass only an
allowlisted display directory. Buttons are capped at two. One writer goroutine owns all
client calls; the default activity write throttle remains 15 seconds.

`StatusProbe` checks cancellation before work and threads its context through discovery
and dialing. A watcher goroutine forces a read/write deadline to `time.Now()` when the
context ends so frame I/O unblocks promptly. The status-only `statusIOTimeout` remains
2 seconds; the daemon/client default remains 5 seconds, and Unix discovery retains its
separate 2-second aggregate dial budget.

Unix discovery tries an absolute `DISCORD_IPC_PATH`, deterministic runtime locations,
known Snap/Flatpak locations, then a deduplicated one-level glob. Candidates must pass
directory, ownership, socket-type, replacement, and peer-credential checks. Windows
validates the named-pipe peer.

**Depends on / used by:** Consumes `internal/detector` and `internal/registry`; used by
the daemon, status command, and TUI activity rendering.

**Open questions / TODO:** None currently.
